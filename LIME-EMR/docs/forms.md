# Forms 📝

Forms are used to collect data from patients and they are made up of pages, sections, questions and answers. There are many features already built into the [Form Engine](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-form-engine-lib) that you can use to customize your forms. You can also use the [Form Builder](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-form-builder) that provides a user-friendly interface to create forms.

Beyond the basic features of forms, you can also use the Form Engine to implement more advanced features such as:

- Answer based filter for questions
- Role based write/modification privilege
- Get previous observations
- Score Calculations
